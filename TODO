Todo:
  Goals:
    ☐ More practice with react and gatsby
    ☐ more practice with animate on scroll
    ☐ more practice with bootstrap
      ☐ actually use the syntax(bonus points for variables and mixins)

  
Notes:
  Day 1 - 14/10/2021
    ☐ Well it was a rough start i wont lie. It took me a long time to find inspiration and get started. The good news is that i do have something to work with
    ☐ The idea is a plant shop with a website that lists their products.
      ☐ Similiar to foxhub it will list info about various plants
      ☐ The first section will list various plants that you can click on to display a popup that will show more information about that plant.
        ☐ As you scroll down the page more of these will appear
      ☐ Each item should have a popup that appears on click
      
      ☐ That's all i have as an idea at the moment but im sure I can come up with other things to add here.
      ☐ Overall, i'm happy i have something up and running and was able to get back on track.

  ☐ hortology.com has more or less the exact same design as i am currently building. I am going to carry on as the point is to practice the actual creation of the design than the originality. It will still be different but it uses the same large image at the top and the images that you can click on to view a modal with product details.

  !help
  ☐ Everytime you change a query you NEED TO RESTART THE SERVER OR YOU WILL GET AN ERROR 
  ☐ I have had to restart the server to get images to show up
  ☐ I am currently on Gatsby V3, not V4
    ☐ The MDX plugin isnt compatible with gatsby 3.14 and upgrading breaks all of my other plugins so I'm just adding another field in the MD file for the moment
  ☐ Don't use "" in .md files, it just leads to things not being correctly called to the front end.



To-Do:
  General:
    ✔ Resize the header image, its 28mb @done(11:58 - 18/10/21)
    ☐ Resist using flex in css, switch to using bootstrap syntax as much as possible
      ✔ Convert current code to css syntax @done(13:40 - 22/10/21)
        ✔ after splitting code into components. @done(13:40 - 22/10/21)
    ✔ (Finally) get a gatsby cloud version working @done(14:08 - 22/10/21)
    ☐ Get gallery to load in on scroll
    ✔ Get Modal Working @done(19:13 - 29/10/21)
      ✔ Everything on the page should be clickable and display a modal with further information @done(19:13 - 29/10/21)
    ☐ Add animations
    ☐ Finished by end of 29th
      ✔ I never made this but that's ok. I took some time to get to know hooks so it was time well spent. I should be finished by 2nd Nov so im not too far away. Just need to smooth out some rough edges and get the load on scroll working. I have learned from the previous project to leave animations to the end. @done(19:13 - 29/10/21)



  
  Section 1 -  Gallery:
    ✔ Get rows of 4 in place @done(18:29 - 21/10/21)
    ✔ Design plant info sections @done(18:29 - 21/10/21)
    ☐ Load Items on Scroll
      ☐ Spent a lot of time on this today (15/10/2021) and I haven't gotten too far. The good news is that I can create the same functionality with a click pretty easily so I have an out if I can't get this to work. I also have another option of just using a scroll event listener to check for the bottom of the page. So, not a lot of success but I did spent a lot of time getting to know hooks so it wasn't a total waste of time. However, i don't want to get bogged down so i'll give myself another half day to figure it out, if I can't then i will use one of the aforementioned outs.
      ☐ 1/11/2021 - Using intersection observer and hooks i was able to get an on scroll effect working. The cards load and animate in as you scroll down the page. The only issue is that on mobile only half of them load in. Not sure what's causing the issue but i think it may have something to do with the container.
        ☐ No further progress in why the interesection is behaving differently. I've added a button as a fall back so that might be how I proceed. I will keep investigating to see if i've missed something obvious.
    ☐ Bootstrap has a modal, use this isntead of the custom popup
      ☐ On second thought, the bootstrap modal is fine but I want to have a bit more control so im making my own
        Creating Popup:
          ✔ I've managed to get a basic animation working and it's looking pretty decent. @done(18:34 - 27/10/21)
            ✔ I've done work on the styles and I'm happy with my work. Not totally finished but in a good state at the moment @done(18:34 - 27/10/21)
          ✔ I've also managed to get a useState hook working that let's me pass info in the popup. @done(18:34 - 27/10/21)
          ✔ I think the next step is to find a way of making this entire thing modular so I can use it with anything I want. It's currently only working in the gallery, ideally there would be no limitation. @done(12:50 - 01/11/21)
            ✔ After a fair amount of time i was able to get this working using setState and by lifting state so that the actual mechanism is a conditional render and not a document.getElementById @done(12:50 - 01/11/21)
            ✔ As for the modulartity, i think it's ok. I think there's still a bit too much duplicate code but i can make refinements to the code as I add the popup to other components. @done(12:50 - 01/11/21)



    ✔ Transfer sass @done(13:40 - 22/10/21)
    ✔ posts isnt propegating into gallery @done(14:26 - 22/10/21)
      ✔ It was, i just didn't convert from ()=>this.show to ()=>show @done(14:26 - 22/10/21)
    ✔ I have finally got the query set up to output different pages depending on what I need. I went through messing with firebase and json before settling on using the blog folder to output what I need using queries. I'm not sure this is the most efficient or even correct way of doing this but Its progress. @done(11:40 - 26/10/21)
    ☐ Populated gallery with items, now to make them appear on scroll
      ☐ Load items on scroll
    ✔ My use of z-index has led to a bit of a mess. I probably need to remove ALL current examples and do it again. @done(15:52 - 29/10/21)

      ☐ ...then style the modal and this will be finished.
