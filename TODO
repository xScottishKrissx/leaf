Notes:
  Day 1 - 14/10/2021
    ☐ Well it was a rough start i wont lie. It took me a long time to find inspiration and get started. The good news is that i do have something to work with
    ☐ The idea is a plant shop with a website that lists their products.
      ☐ Similiar to foxhub it will list info about various plants
      ☐ The first section will list various plants that you can click on to display a popup that will show more information about that plant.
        ☐ As you scroll down the page more of these will appear
        ☐ Each of these items should have a corresponding page you can go to
      
      ☐ That's all i have as an idea at the moment but im sure I can come up with other things to add here.
      ☐ Overall, i'm happy i have something up and running and was able to get back on track.
