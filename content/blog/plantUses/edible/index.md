title : "Edible Plants"
excerpt : There are over 20,000 species of edible plants in the world yet fewer than 20 species now provide 90% of our food. However, there are hundreds of less well known edible plants from all around the world which are both delicious and nutritious.
modalDescription : "Picking and collecting your own food is quite trendy nowadays. Of course, in your own garden this is common, but what do you know about roads and paths in the countryside? There are many wild plants that are edible and grow within armâ€™s reach along pathways, in fields, hedges and in the woods. Leaves, flowers, berries: depending on the plant, all or some of the parts are edible and add flavor, vitamins and definitely score for creativeness in your meal preparations!"
