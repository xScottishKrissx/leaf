title : Preservation
description : It is the unfortunate reality of the modern world that most of the planets life is going extinct. Human driven climate change is leading us towards an extinction event greater than any seen before. Leaf.com can't fix that but we can keep an accurate record of every plant so that future generations can look back and marvel at what we squandered. We also have a number of physical books and digtial alternatives to ensure that our records carry on whatever the future may bring". It is also our hope to open physical locations and museums to further this effort.
