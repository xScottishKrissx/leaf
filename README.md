<p>My main purpose with this project was to get practice with everything I have worked on across recent projects. Visually, it's a much simpler design than I've been doing but I knew that I would be taking on a decent amount of new learning and so I didn't want to get too distracted from my main aims.</p>

<h2>leaf.com</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>leaf.com is supposed to serve as a sort of plant/flower database. I'll be honest in saying the content for this is mostly pointless and arbitrary and was just a vehicle for the practice as described below. Moving forward i want my projects to be built around more meaningful and useful subjects. </p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I don't actually have a lot of exposure to hooks so for leaf I wanted to get more involved, so making use of useState and useEffect I was able to produce the animate on scroll effect for the plant gallery. In addition, I made use of useState to get the popup working. I now feel a lot more comfortable with these hooks, specifically, when and how to use them. There are obviously more things to learn as these are the fundamentals but at least I have my foot in the door and can be more confident when approaching the more advanced topics.</p>

<h2>Gatsby + GraphiQL</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In previous projects, I have not used graphiQL as often as I would have liked so for this project I decided I wanted to get as much of the page being stored in .md files as possible so I could create the code needed to access and display them. In order for this to work, I had to figure out how to get multiple queries working. I learned that all you needed to do is to name your queries and reference that, and the correct sub-directory when accessing the needed information. This allowed me to render everything, apart from section headers, using markdown files.</p>

<h2>Intersection Observer + Animate on Scroll</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As mentioned I needed to use hooks to get this working which took me a while to figure out. I eventually did after a lot of reading the documentation along with trial and error. The main difference between this version and the one I used in the Attica project is that I needed to update an array instead of adding a class. This meant using useState to set a new array when required.</p>

<h2>React Bootstrap</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this project, I decided to use the bootstrap utilities&nbsp;syntax as much as possible to see what would happen and how it would change my workflow. This meant everything that is listed under the utilities&nbsp;section in the documentation had to be used in place of sass. In the end, I'm not sure if using bootstrap syntax is better than just well organised sass especially if you're dealing with a larger codebase. It was ok here because I have limited elements on the page but I think I would prefer not to set things like padding and margin on an element by element basis, especially if they're all using the same values. I understand the benefits of doing it this way as anyone who needs to change something can, as long as they're familiar with bootstrap, but it wouldn't be my preference. Still, it was an interesting experience and going forward I think I will land somewhere in the middle where I will use bootstrap utilities for containers and wrappers, then use sass for everything else.</p>

<h2>SASS</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's been a while since I properly used sass so while I have used it in the previous project, I didn't really go that far. In this project, I made use of storing variables and mixins in a separate file and importing them.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be argued that this is the least impressive of my recent projects but for me, it was very useful. I learned a lot about hooks and got a lot more practice with the Gatsby development cycle on top of the continuous exposure to React. I was also able to advance with SASS and made extensive use of react-bootstrap and bootstrap utilities&nbsp;for most of the design. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Overall a good project but, as mentioned at the start, moving forward I want to design and build things that aren't just vehicles for practising individual web development principles. At the very least I want to incorporate more API and design around websites or products I would actually use or be interested in. These recent projects are useful to an extent but I will admit to struggling a bit with having to come up with fake content for a fake website. I think it's time to move on from that.</p>
